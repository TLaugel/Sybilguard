Detection-of-Fake-Accounts-of-a-Social-Network--Python-
=======================================================

Social graphs and Random Walks



This project aims at proposing a method, based on random walks, to automatically detect fake accounts that people might create of a social network. It is based on the algorithm SybilGuard, a novel program created to crack down on fake accounts creation.
This project has been done in the Programming Course at ENSAE ParisTech in 2012, in collaboration with Morgane AUSTERN.

The first part of this project explain the mathematical ideas on which the algorithm relies on: random walks, social graphs theory...

The second part of this project details the implementation of the algorithm and the definition of a 'detection criterion'.

The final part of this project analyse the results of the algorithm, and the issues met during its developpment.
